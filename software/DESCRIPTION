Description: Excess count detection ('excode') in epidemiological time series
    is an important part of public health surveillance systems. The 'excode'
    package provides a flexible framework that implements well established
    approaches to control for seasonality, long-term trends and historic
    events, but also allows the use of customized models. By combining
    hidden Markov models and generalized linear models, 'excode' explicitly
    models normally expected case counts and expected excess case counts.
